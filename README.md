In this project, I use the convolutional layers of pre-trained VGGNet with Tensorflow to classify flower images from the [TensorFlow inception tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining) (5 classes). An accuracy of 96% is achieved.

This is an adaptation of a project carried out in the context of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation by Udacity.
